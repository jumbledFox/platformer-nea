the future....

one day i was riding on the 6:10 Ultra-Sonic,
a usual Blargsday morning to my post.
my pod had whizzed and whipped and weaved in a way most symphonic!
but i've seen it all before, and so have most.

i was approaching Î»2nd street, the place where i alight,
and soon stepped onto concrete, non the wiser
about what would soon blind my eyes. a bright blue flash before my sight!
(beneath the popups plastered on my visor).

this otherwordly blue (maybe seen on a neptune safari)
caused i and many others to inspect,
and there charred on the ground, with hair white and eyes starry,
he looked up to me and screamed "I'VE DONE IT! IT'S PERFECT!".

the pale old man, with goggles and a labcoat, grabbed my hand,
"boy you MUST show me all around this place!"
"where are you from?!" i shouted out, still trying to understand, 
and he replied "another time and space!".

now a teleporter failure, is a rare but real danger,
it fries the brain and leaves a person manic.
it seems the latest victim to be claimed is this frail stranger,
but i sure don't want to send him in a panic!

so to humour him and bide my time i led the man along,
"i simply must learn more about this age!"
but soon, dumb curiousity will turn, it won't be long,
before the madness swells it into rage.

so i took him to the threedies, but the depth made him feel queasy,
afterall, by now, his brain is surely mush.
to cool his mind, i took him to the park, which should've been easy,
but when a drone zipped by, he ducked into a bush!

"this final place, that you will LOVE, of scientifical acclaim
is sure to blow your mind, i know it should.",
"what is it, boy?" was the last thing he asked me, as the nurses came,
and locked that crazy stranger up for good.
